# Desktron
A cross-platform desktop application. Developing with GitHub's Electron framework.

*It turned into a small application for my work!*

We go through a very tedious and repetative process with Apple's GSX system for each repair done. I want to automate that process.
I'm usign Selenium Web Driver, Github's Electron, and neDB as a NoSQL database for use with javascript.


*I'll add more detail into this later*
